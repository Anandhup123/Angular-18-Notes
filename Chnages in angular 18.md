Angular 18 introduces several significant enhancements over its predecessors, focusing on performance improvements, developer experience, and advanced features. Here's an overview of the key changes:

**1. Zoneless Change Detection with Signals**

Angular 18 introduces zoneless change detection, eliminating the need for Zone.js. This approach enhances performance and simplifies change detection. Additionally, the introduction of Signals provides a more granular and reactive way to manage application state updates.

**2. Function-Based Route Redirects**

The framework now supports function-based route redirects, allowing for more dynamic and flexible redirection logic. This feature enables developers to implement redirects based on conditions such as authentication status.

**3. Enhanced Developer Tooling**

Angular 18 brings improvements to developer tools, including the Angular DevTools extension. These enhancements offer better insights into application performance, dependency management, and state changes, aiding in debugging and optimization.

**4. Stability of Material 3 and Component Dev Kit (CDK)**

Material 3 and the Angular CDK have reached stability in Angular 18, ensuring full compatibility and optimization for use with the latest version. This stability provides developers with a reliable set of tools for building UI components.

**5. Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Enhancements**

Angular 18 introduces improvements to server-side rendering, including i18n hydration support, better debugging capabilities, and hydration support in Angular Material. These enhancements aim to improve the performance and user experience of SSR applications.

**6. New Observable in Reactive Forms**

Reactive Forms now include a new Observable called `events`, which emits various types of changes in the form. This addition combines subscriptions to `valueChanges` and `statusChanges`, providing a more comprehensive way to handle form events.

**7. Integration with Firebase Hosting**

Angular 18 simplifies deployment by integrating with Firebase Hosting, streamlining the process of deploying Angular applications to Firebase.

**8. Enhanced Form Control State Events**

The framework introduces enhanced form control state events, offering more granular control and better handling of form state changes.

These updates in Angular 18 aim to provide developers with a more efficient, flexible, and powerful framework for building modern web applications.
